###### A beginners guide to the openshift CLI.

### Basic Commands:
1. Startup openshift cluster:

  oc cluster up
  
  
2. Shutdown openshift cluster:

  oc cluster down
  
  
3. Make a new project: (also changes current working project to this project that you will make)

  oc new-project <your-project-name>
  
  
  
4. Change project:

  oc project <your-project-name>
 
 
 
5. Show all projects of current user:
 
  oc projects
 
 
 
6. Login:
   - As a normal user:
  
  oc login -u <your-username> -p <your-password>
  
   - As an admin:
   
  oc login -u system:admin
  
  
  
7. Give admin rights to the developer(or any user):
  
  oc adm policy  --as system:admin add-cluster-role-to-user cluster-admin developer



### Deployment (The complete process):

1. Make a docker image out of a project:

- https://deis.com/blog/2015/creating-sharing-first-docker-image/

2. Get tags from various sources and add it to your project:
  - From current image stream:
  
  oc tag openshift/ruby:2.0 yourproject/ruby:tip
  
  - From docker hub: 
  
  oc tag --source=docker openshift/origin:latest yourproject/ruby:tip
  
3. Run the new app: (similar to `docker run` command)

  oc new-app yourproject/ruby:tip
  
4. Check status of deployment:

  oc status 

5. Expose the deployed application:

  oc expose service ruby:tip
  
### Storage:
1. Get a list of all Persistant Volumes:

  oc get pv
  
- You need to be logged in as admin to run this command.

2. Add a Persistant Volume Claim to a Persistant Volume:

  oc volume deploymentconfigs/docker-registry --add --name=registry-storage -t pvc --claim-name=my_storage_claim --overwrite
  
3. Get docker-registry information: 

  $ oc project default
  $ oc get dc/docker-registry -o json
